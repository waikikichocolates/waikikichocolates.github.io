Your choice for Callebaut is a choice for cocoa farmers to thrive. For every Calletâ„¢ of the Finest Belgian Chocolate range, Callebaut sources 100% sustainable cocoa. And for every pack you purchase, a part is reinvested in the farmers and their communities. By partnering with the Cocoa Horizons Foundation which works directly with farmer groups, we support farmer training and empower young farmers & women farmers to excel in their craft.
